Description:
This project implements the Bitcoin mining algorithm optimized for the Nvidia Quadro NVS 295 GPU found in the PHO 207 lab machines. Currently the CUDA portion of the project only works on faked data stored in test.h and is meant to be a proof of concept to experiment with optimizing just the mining portion of Bitcoin. A complete implementation that interfaces with the Bitcoin network will eventually be completed and posted to Github. For now, the code in the future_work directory is provided as is and is the beginnings of that side project. It's based on the libblkmaker library which generates block headers using the getblocktemplate JSON RPC provided by the bitcoind.

Compilation Instructions:
cd code/
make all

Usage:
1. Edit the block header in test.h if desired. The specification for this can be found in the Bitcoin Developer's Reference.
2. Run ./gpu_miner. To check all 4 billion nonces should take about 90 seconds.

NOTE: Not all block headers will have a solution. Good luck ;)

Sample output:

-bash-4.1$ ./gpu_miner
Nonce found! 68c664a2
